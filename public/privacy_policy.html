            On Pixel Planet, people's right to privacy is essential. It is part of our core values we strive to uphold in all that we do. We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful
            means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we
            store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We don’t collect or share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, information we collect via analytics is aggregate and anonymous. The only personally identifying information we receive is when visitors contact us of their own accord via our email or contact form. We treat this information as confidential and do not share it except when required to by law, when required to verify your email or phone number, or in order to provide specific services the visitor requested. We may use tools that record actions and steps taken by visitors (also aggregate and anonymous) only to help improve the user interface and interactions, fix bugs, and improve flow of information on our website across all devices and browsers.

        <!-- <h3 class="text-ultra">Layman's Terms</h3>
        <p>
            We started Pixel Planet because we were tired of the greedy and corrupt practices in tech. We don’t approve
            of how
            companies hang free services in front of users like a carrot - in order to turn users and their data into
            commodities to
            be sold to external companies with questionable ethics.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We operate under the principle of people over profits and respect our visitors’ right to privacy. Because of that,
            we use
            basic analytics in order to see anonymous information about where visitors to our site are coming from and
            the search terms
            they used to find us. This is only to ensure we are able to serve and reach our audience better.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We do not use trackers to track users across the web, we do not use deceptive practices to identify visitors
            in order to tailor targeted ads to them (we don’t even show ads on our site). And if we ever include
            affiliate links anywhere in our blog posts or website, they will always be clearly marked and identified as
            affiliate links and for our users’ benefit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Any information users submit via our contact form or email is treated as confidential and we never sell
            leads or visitor
            data to anyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We never, in no uncertain terms, sell your data to any third party services for profit. Ever. And we never
            will.
            Our only goal in using basic analytics is to help grow our business in an ethical manner and reach audiences
            who may
            find our services helpful.
        </p>
